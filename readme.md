# Taskly

A sophisticated task management system implementing Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns. Built with clean architecture principles and Domain-Driven Design (DDD), it provides a robust foundation for task creation, assignment, and tracking with complete event history.

## Architecture Overview

### Solution Structure
- `src/Api`: REST API endpoints and application bootstrapping
- `src/Application`: Command/Query handlers, DTOs, and business logic
- `src/Domain`: Domain models, events, and business rules
- `src/Infrastructure`: External dependencies and data persistence
- `src/Projector`: Event subscription handlers for read models and notifications

### Design Patterns
- Event Sourcing: Store state changes as events
- CQRS: Separate read and write operations
- DDD: Rich domain model with bounded contexts
- Clean Architecture: Independent layers with dependency rules

## Tech Stack

### Core Technology
- .NET 9.0
- C# 12
- ASP.NET Core Web API

### Data Storage
- EventStoreDB: Event storage and subscriptions
- PostgreSQL 17: Snapshot storage
- Redis: Read model caching with RedisJSON support

### Tools & Libraries
